def imextendedmin(image, h, connectivity=1):
    """Extended-minima transform.
    The extended minima transform is the regional minima of the h-minima transform.
    The implementation follows the MATLAB function under the same name.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray
        The input array on which to perform imextendedmin.
    h : float
        Any local minima shallower than this will be flattened.
    connectivity : int, optional
        Determines which elements are considered as neighbors of the central
        element. Elements up to a squared distance of `connectivity` from
        the center are considered neighbors. If connectivity=1, no diagonal
        elements are neighbors.

    Returns
    -------
    bool ndarray
        True at places of the extended minima.
